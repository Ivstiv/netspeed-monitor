# netspeed-monitor

A POSIX compliant shell script that checks internet speeds every 10 minutes and generates a plot in PNG format every 24 hours. Also capable of sending the image to a webhook. (I use it for Discord webhooks)

## FAQ
- The --plot argument asks you for save location and if you want to send the image via webhook.
- The logs are not being cleaned automatically, so your logs folder will grow indefinitely.
- Probably a good idea to leave the script running in tmux or screen session: `screen -dmS netspeed-monitor sh netspeed-monitor.sh`
- Other questions - find me in [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/VMSDGVD).
- You can probably write your own endpoint for the webhook. Here is an example in PHP:
